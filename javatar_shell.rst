|J| Shell
=============

|J|'s shell is working like normal shell terminal. The difference between |J|'s shell and another shells is |J|'s shell will send your input by pressing Enter/Return (that give you ability to reedit your content on current line).

While |J|'s shell is running, you can close the view to force quit your application.

.. warning:: We cannot gurranteed that output or input is corrected when you are enter while |J|'s shell is printing an output from the shell since |J|'s shell is not set the view to Read-Only while printing.
